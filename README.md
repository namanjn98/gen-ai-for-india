# Generative AI hackathon ideas

## Themes to get started

**1. AI tutor to teach English**

Given the vast majority of languages in our country, majority of Indians aspire to learn English in order to communicate with people from different backgrounds and progress in their professional lives.  

Inspired Khan Academy and Duolingo's versions of Gen AI powered tutors, there is an opportunity to build a friendly product to help kids and adults learn to speak, read and write in English through their native language.

**2. Financial Advisor**

Lack of financial literacy is a big challenge in India. People are unable to understand financial terms, products and instruments. 

Inspired by Liquide's AI bot for financial advisory, build a personalised bot to help you invest money in equity/debt markets, choose the insurance policy, understand a business and create a retirement plan. 

**3. Support Creators**

India's buying decisions are primarily driven by Internet search and social media influencers. Building tools for creators such as AI driven video editing, video dubbing in multiple languages, automatic Advertisement creation, news summarisation etc.
